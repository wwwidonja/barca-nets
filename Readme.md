This is the work in proggress repository of Football match passmaps of Barcelona matches in the 2018/19 and 2019/20 seasons.

The networks in .pajek format can be found in the `nets` folder.

All data was generated from the StatsBomb Open data, accessed as part of the `statsbombpy` package.

Passmaps are generated on a player basis, currently considering substitutions as a like-for-like replacement, encoding the players as the same node.

Carries are currently not included in the networks.
